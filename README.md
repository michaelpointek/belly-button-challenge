Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard repository! This project presents an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the fascinating world of microbial species inhabiting human navels, as cataloged in the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.

Background
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset offers intriguing insights into the microbial communities residing in human navels. It highlights that while some microbial species are prevalent in a significant portion of individuals, others are relatively rare. This project aims to visualize and explore this dataset through interactive charts and graphs.

Getting Started
To begin exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard, follow these steps:

Clone Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Access Starter Code: The necessary files, including index.html, samples.json, and the static folder, are included in the repository.
Local Deployment: Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the dashboard locally.
Features
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard offers the following features:

Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in an individual's navel. Users can select different samples from the dropdown menu to view corresponding OTUs.

Bubble Chart: Presents a bubble chart showcasing each sample, with OTU IDs on the x-axis, sample values on the y-axis, marker size indicating sample values, marker colors representing OTU IDs, and text values displaying OTU labels.

Sample Metadata Display: Showcases an individual's demographic information, displaying each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.

Dynamic Plot Updates: All plots update dynamically when a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu.

Deployment
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access. You can access the deployed dashboard using the following link:
